      <b>Who I am: </b>
      </p>

      <p>
      This is a weekly meeting for sharing skills and best practices for 
      scientific computation. Based on The Hacker Within Scientific Computing 
      Group from the University of Wisconsin Madison, a small group of nuclear 
      engineers at UC Berkeley had a couple such meetings in Fall 2013. In 
      spring semester of 2014, this grew into a more structured set of skill 
      sharing sessions for scientific software development (testing, data 
      management, version control, literate programming etc. ) The goal is to 
      learn cool skills and incorporate these practices into our workflows. This 
      meeting would be a great venue for introducing new libraries, showing off 
      useful features of a neutronics code you're using, or bringing up a 
      computational problem you're having.

      <p>
      Anyone interested in software development best practices is welcome to 
      come to our meetings. Note that the first hour has a particular emphasis on 
      computational nuclear engineering and neutronics analysis best practices. 
      The second hour of the meeting, however, will be domain-inspecific!

      Wednesdays at 3:30pm. The meeting should last about two hours. See the 
      <a href="http://thehackerwithin.github.io/berkeley">blog</a> or the
      <a href="http://bit.ly/1cqFKuh">calendar</a> for the topic for this week.
      To keep up with meetings, you may want to  
      <a 
        href="https://calmail.berkeley.edu/manage/list/listinfo/ucb-hacker-within@lists.berkeley.edu">sign 
        up for the listhost</a>.
      </p>


      <p>
      <b>How:</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      Participating is really easy. 
      <li>At <b>3:30pm</b>, there is a short tutorial/discussion of some neutronics 
      topic.</li>
      <li>Next, at <b>4:30pm</b>, there is a tutorial/discussion about a purely 
      computational topic. (feel free to only join for this part).</li>
      <li>Finally, there will be a time for a couple of Lightning Talks, which 
      are 5-10 minute blasts of information about a particular topic or 
      question of interest to the group.</li>

      To volunteer to give either of these talks, 
      just let the listhost know by email at <a 
        href="mailto:ucb-hacker-within@lists.berkeley.edu">ucb-hacker-within@lists.berkeley.edu</a>. 
      <b>Note</b> that the lightning talk time is a good way to bring a 
      question to the group. If you have a bug you need help with, here's the 
      place to ask many ears about it at once.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Why: </b>
      </p>
      <p>
      The tenets of scientiÔ¨Åc endeavor (e.g., data control, reproducibility, 
      comprehensive documentation, and peer review) suffer in projects that fail 
      to make use of current development tools such as unit testing, version 
      control, automated documentation, and others.</p>
      <p>
      To avoid these pitfalls, this weekly meeting exists for sharing skills and best practices for 
      computational scientific applications. This group is modeled after The 
      Hacker Within, which  began as a student organization at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and 
      is now reborn as a collection of such chapters around the world. Each of 
      the chapters convenes a community of scientists, at all levels of their 
      education and training, to share their knowledge and best practices in 
      using computing to accomplish their work.</p>
