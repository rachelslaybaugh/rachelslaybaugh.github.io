## Areas of Research
My research is based in numerical methods for neutral particle transport
(solving the Boltzmann transport equation) with an emphasis on
high performance computing. These methods are often inspired by the physics of
the problem at hand, developments in computer hardware, or both.


I apply these methods to reactor design, shielding, and
nuclear security and nonproliferation. 

<a name="top">In particular, my research group works on 
- [Deterministic solver methods](#deterministic)
- [Hybrid methods](#hybrid) (using deterministic results to accelerate Monte Carlo)
- [Metahueristic optimization](#meta) algorithms
- [Applications](#apps) in reactor design, shielding, and nuclear security and
nonproliferation
- [Monte Carlo](#mc) on advanced architectures (e.g. GPUs and MICs)
- [Nonclassical](#nonclass) neutron transport
- [Scientific software](#software) development
- [Other](#other)

### <a name="mc">Monte Carlo
GPUs have the potential to greatly enhance calculation speeds for Monte Carlo
calculations. However, the process of conducting Monte Carlo for neutral
particle transport on GPUs is not straightforward. We are developing a code,
WARP, to do just this and there are a variety of remaining challenges in terms
of methods, implementation, and studying impact.

### <a name="nonclass">Nonclassical Transport
In classical particle transport, the probability that a particle interacts with
the background medium is proportional to the path length traveled by that
particle, and the proportionality constant depends on the density of the medium
and on the particle's energy. This typically leads to an exponential attenuation
law, i.e. the particle flux decreases as an exponential function of the path
length (Beer-Lambert law). In certain inhomogeneous random systems, however, a
nonexponential attenuation law arises due to spatial correlations between the
fuel pebbles in the core. We develop methods to study nonclassical solvers in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions.

### <a name="software">Scientific Software Development
PyNE is an open source Python library for Nuclear Engineering (http://pyne.io/,
https://github.com/pyne/pyne). There are a variety of projects that are often
changing. My group occasionally contributes things to PyNE, like a collection of
spatial solvers or a Bateman Equation solver.
