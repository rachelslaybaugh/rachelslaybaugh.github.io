## About Me 
 
I am an Assistant Professor of [Nuclear
Engineering](http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/) at the [University of
California, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/). I received a BS in Nuclear Engineering from Penn
State in 2006 where I worked as a licensed nuclear reactor operator. I went
on to the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison to earn an MS in 2008 and a PhD in
2011 in Nuclear Engineering and Engineering Physics along with a certificate in
Energy Analysis and Policy. 

Throughout my career, I have been engaged in computational science,
educational outreach, starting an absurd number of student organizations,
attending far too many conferences, and also having fun. Fun includes things
like travel (I backpacked in Central America for three months), cooking (because
weird food is the best), exercise (yoga, biking, climbing, etc.), and generally
enjoying adventures in the Bay Area.

## My Work

* Research based in numerical methods for [neutral particle
 transport](http://www.nuclear-power.net/nuclear-power/reactor-physics/neutron-diffusion-theory/neutron-transport-theory-boltzmann-transport-equation/) with an emphasis on supercomputing:
  - Deterministic solver methods
  - Monte Carlo methods
  - hybrid methods (using deterministic results to speed up Monte Carlo)
  - Advanced architectures (e.g. GPUs and MICs)
* Applications in reactor design, shielding, and nuclear security and
  nonproliferation
* Scientific software development with an emphasis on reproducibility and
  transparency

## Stuff I'm Extra Proud Of
I have the honor of being involved in all of these organizations and activities
* Member of DOE's Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee ([NEAC](https://www.energy.gov/ne/services/nuclear-energy-advisory-committee))
* Special Government Employee doing consulting work with [ARPA-E](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/)
* Founder of the [Nuclear Innovation Bootcamp](http://nuclearbootcamp.berkeley.edu/)
* Senior Fellow at the [Breakthrough Institute](http://thebreakthrough.org/)
* Senior Fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science ([BIDS](https://bids.berkeley.edu/))
* [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) Instructor
