## Courses
I teach courses about reactor theory, numerical methods, and software development
practices. I also sponsor a course that does hands-on science experiments with
first graders at
underserved elementary schools in Oakland. 

You can find my course materials here:
- [NE250](https://github.com/rachelslaybaugh/NE250) Nuclear Reactor Theory
- [NE255](https://github.com/rachelslaybaugh/NE255) Numerical Simulations in Radiation Transport
- [NE155](https://github.com/rachelslaybaugh/NE155) Introduction to Numerical
  Simulations in Radiation Transport
- [NE24](https://rachelslaybaugh.github.io/NE24/) Putting the Science in
  Computational Science
- [DeCal](https://www.facebook.com/groups/762983250499156/) Science in Oakland
  Elementary Schools: Every other week Berkeley students will travel to
underserved Oakland elementary schools to lead hands-on science experiments with
at-risk first graders. The bulk of the coursework is designing and implementing
these interactive science experiences. We are working with [SuperStars
Literacy](http://www.superstarsliteracy.org/),
a Literacy intervention nonprofit, to add a science component.
